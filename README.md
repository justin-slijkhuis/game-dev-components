# game-dev-components

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Game dev components".

It's purpose is to build a library full of game development components that can be used to build a game.

## Learning

- C#
- Perlin noise
- World generation
- KÃ¶ppen climate classification
- Component diagram
- Patterns
- SOLID
- GRASP

## Requirements

- The world must be able to generate infinitely.
- The world must be able to be unique.
- The world must be able to be shared with others using a seed resulting in exactly the same world generation.
- The world must consist of the by developer chosen or given classification/biomes.
- The world must be fluid, so no spontaneous borders or insanely small biomes/structures/attributes.
- The world must be able to contain structures given by the developer.
- Structures must be able to have multiple version with each having a certain chance to spawn.
- The world must be easily configured by passing it percentages of certain aspects and attributes the world must consist of.
- Different types of world generation must be possible (Open world, dungeons, layers, etc.).
- The world must be able to be generated for 2D and 3D games.
