# Game dev components

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Game dev components".

It's purpose is to build a library full of game development components that can be used to build a game.

## Learning

- C#
- Perlin noise
- World generation
- KÃ¶ppen climate classification
- Component diagram
- Domain model
- Patterns
- SOLID
- GRASP

## Requirements

### World generation

- The world must be able to generate infinitely.
- The world must be able to be unique.

- The world must be able to be generated for 2D and 3D games.

### Game rendering

- A new application must open for the game to render (Windows, Linux and Mac).
- The render must easily and quickly be able to change its content.
- Must be able to render 2D and 3D games.

### Game saving
